# Refal: Real-time Vision Human Fall Detector
Refal is a software project that uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect human falls in real-time. The project is designed to work with live video streams from cameras and provides real-time alerts when a fall is detected. The project has several dependencies, which include OpenCV, OpenVINO, Supergradients, Roboflow, and Python.


bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install intel-openvino-dev
pip install supergradients
pip install roboflow
Usage
To use Refal, you need to import it into your Python code and call its functions. For example, to detect human falls in a live video stream, you can use the following code:

python
Copy code
import refal

# Initialize a video stream
video_stream = refal.initialize_video_stream()

# Loop over the frames in the video stream
while True:
    # Read a frame from the video stream
    frame = refal.read_frame(video_stream)
    
    # Detect human falls in the frame
    results = refal.detect_falls(frame)
    
    # Display the results and alert if a fall is detected
    refal.show_results(frame, results)
    if refal.is_fall_detected(results):
        refal.alert()
