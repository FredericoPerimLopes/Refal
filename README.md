Refal: Real-time Vision Human Fall Detector
Refal is a software project that uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect human falls in real-time. The project is designed to work with live video streams from cameras and provides real-time alerts when a fall is detected. The project has several dependencies, which include OpenCV, OpenVINO, Supergradients, Roboflow, and Python.

Dependencies
OpenCV: an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library that provides a wide range of algorithms for image and video processing.
OpenVINO: an open-source toolkit that enables deep learning inference on various devices and platforms.
Supergradients: a deep learning library that provides a high-level interface for building and training neural networks.
Roboflow: a platform that provides tools and services for computer vision workflows, including data labeling, augmentation, and model training.
Python: an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.
Installation
To install Refal, you need to have all the dependencies installed on your system. You can install them using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install intel-openvino-dev
pip install supergradients
pip install roboflow
Usage
To use Refal, you need to import it into your Python code and call its functions. For example, to detect human falls in a live video stream, you can use the following code:

python
Copy code
import refal

# Initialize a video stream
video_stream = refal.initialize_video_stream()

# Loop over the frames in the video stream
while True:
    # Read a frame from the video stream
    frame = refal.read_frame(video_stream)
    
    # Detect human falls in the frame
    results = refal.detect_falls(frame)
    
    # Display the results and alert if a fall is detected
    refal.show_results(frame, results)
    if refal.is_fall_detected(results):
        refal.alert()
